            <ul>
                <li>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold"</li>
                <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.</li>
                <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their global score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
